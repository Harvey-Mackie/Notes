# Build ZenZone App
Build ZenZone iOS app and achieve the following
- Deploy app to App Store
- Create Marketing Plan (website, ads etc)
Aim - Make Â£200-500
# Create Education Business 
Create online courses to educate people about Software Engineering. My USP is the simplicity and practicality which I will explain - using project based learning.

My pricing strategy will be cheap (one time purchase to own the course) and then once I have a good following, I'll transition over to a subscription based model - pay X per month and gain access to all courses.

The coursers will be inspired from - https://www.amigoscode.com/courses, books I've read, Plural sight etc

The courses which I have in mind are
- Building Swift App - use ZenZone as a template
- Learning Spring Boot Essentials
- Learning Docker and Kubernetes essentials
- Learning Git
- Learn GitHub CLI - FREE
- Learn Event Driven Architechture
- Learn Domain Driven Design
- Learn Solution Architchture (book margaret sent)
